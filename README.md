## ✅ Step 5: Share Repo
- After push → go to your repo page on GitHub.  
- Copy the **repository link**.  
- Use that in your internship submission.  

👉 Do you want me to **write the README.md content** for **all your projects (Blog Website + Secure Docs + E-Gram Panchayat)** in one repo, or do you prefer to create **separate repos for each project**?
